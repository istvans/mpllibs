maybe monoid
============
Abel Sinkovics

This is the C++ template metaprogramming equivalent of Haskell's Maybe monoid.

general information
-------------------

* header: +<mpllibs/metamonad/maybe.hpp>+
* tag of monad: +maybe_tag<T>+ where +T+ is the tag of the value wrapped by
  +just+.
* mempty: +nothing+
* mappend:
** When both arguments are +nothing+, the result is +nothing+
** When one argument is +nothing+, the result is the other argument
** When none of the arguments is +nothing+, the two values wrapped by +just+
   get merged by using +mappend+ on the monoid formed by +T+ values. The result
   of this gets wrapped by +just+.
